UI.Codex.Title=UFOPaedia
UI.Codex.codex_welcome.Title=Introduction 
UI.Codex.codex_welcome0=This UFOPaedia contains information about playing Terra Invicta. Select a topic to the left for details on game mechanics.<br/><br/>New topics may occasionally appear when technologies unlock new mechanics.<br/><br/>For information on how to navigate the game's interfaces, please start a campaign as the Resistance with the tutorial activated.
UI.Codex.codex_factions.Title=Factions
UI.Codex.codex_factions0=With the nations of Earth unable to reach consensus on how to approach the alien arrival on their own, covert transnational factions of like-minded people have become the dominant players in world affairs. Each is driven by an ideology on how to address alien activities on Earth. These factions will seek to invest in and control the governments of Earth to advance their goals. You are leading one of these factions.
UI.Codex.codex_factions1=The inner leadership circle of each faction is its <h>council</h>. Councilors will go on missions to help you gain power over Earth's nations and discover the aliens' goals on Earth. Factions also may gain control over <h>armies,</h> and as the story progresses, they may build <h>habitats</h> and <h>fleets</h> in space.
UI.Codex.codex_factions2=Factions cannot be entirely eliminated in Terra Invicta. They have emerged from the beliefs of the people of Earth. People can be swayed and organizational structures removed, but ideas can't fully die. What matters is how much power the people holding those ideologies possess.
UI.Codex.codex_objectives.Title=Objectives
UI.Codex.codex_objectives0=During the campaign, each faction will have one or more objectives to fulfill at any given time. Completing objectives will lead to uncovering information about the aliens and their true purpose in our Solar System. Objectives can also unlock special research projects and orgs for a faction.
UI.Codex.codex_resources.Title=Resources
UI.Codex.codex_resources0=Factions must manage several key resources on Earth and, as the campaign progresses, in space.
UI.Codex.codex_resources1=Earth resources are generated from a variety of sources, but space resources (water, volatiles, metals, noble metals and fissiles) can only come from developing technology to mine space bodies other than Earth and using electromagnetic catapults to launch them to where they are needed.
UI.Codex.codex_resources2=For readibility, Terra Invicta will occasionally use alphabetic suffixes with very large or small numbers, such as "10K." Capital letters are for big numbers greater than 1,000:
UI.Codex.codex_resources3=K: Thousands (1,000)
UI.Codex.codex_resources4=M: Millions (1,000,000)
UI.Codex.codex_resources5=B: Billions (1,000,000,000)
UI.Codex.codex_resources6=T: Trillions (1,000,000,000,000)
UI.Codex.codex_resources7=Q: Quadrillions (1,000,000,000,000,000)
UI.Codex.codex_resources8=Small letters are for fractional numbers less than 1:
UI.Codex.codex_resources9=m: milli- (.001)
UI.Codex.codex_resources10=u: micro- (.000 001)
UI.Codex.codex_resources11=n: nano- (.000 000 001)
UI.Codex.codex_resources12=p: pico- (.000 000 000 001)									// 1e-12
UI.Codex.codex_resources13=f: femto- (.000 000 000 000 001)
UI.Codex.codex_resources14=a: atto- (.000 000 000 000 000 001)
UI.Codex.codex_resources15=z: zepto- (.000 000 000 000 000 000 001)
UI.Codex.codex_resources16=y: yocto- (.000 000 000 000 000 000 000 001)

UI.Codex.codex_missionControl0=<LOC,UI.GeneralControls.MissionControlDetail>
UI.Codex.codex_missionControl1=Mission control is generated primarily by ground-based facilities on Earth, but some orgs and hab modules can also grant this resource.
UI.Codex.codex_researchIncome.Title=<color=#FFFFFFFF><sprite name="research"></color> Research
UI.Codex.codex_researchIncome0=<LOC,UI.GeneralControls.ResearchDetail>
UI.Codex.codex_researchIncome1=Research is generated by nations, councilors, orgs, and hab modules. Many councilors, orgs, and hab modules offer bonuses for specific research <h>categories</h>.
UI.Codex.codex_researchIncome2=Research income also receives a bonus for the number of different investigations your faction is taking part in, so it may be useful to spread out your efforts. But individual category bonuses are somewhat reduced if you are employing them simultaneously across multiple projects.
UI.Codex.codex_projectsIncome.Title=<color=#FFFFFFFF><sprite name="projects"></color> Projects
UI.Codex.codex_projectsIncome0=The projects resource represents a faction's ability to engineer specific objects or outcomes.
UI.Codex.codex_projectsIncome1=It governs how many simultaneous projects a faction may pursue and how fast it completes them. Factions get one project slot for free. They receive a second project slot (to work on two projects simultaneously) if a councilor has an org with a project income value. They receive a third project slot if they have built a hab module with a project income value. Multiple orgs or hab modules with project income values provides bonuses to all projects the faction is working on.

UI.Codex.codex_diplomacy.Title=Faction Diplomacy
UI.Codex.codex_diplomacy0=By using the <h>Contact</h> mission on a councilor from another faction, a councilor may initiate trade discussions with the leader of that faction. Successful trades can serve to lower hostility between factions.
UI.Codex.codex_councilors.Title=Councilors
UI.Codex.codex_councilors0=Councilors are a faction's primary proxies on Earth and may also go to space to advance its interests there. Factions may initially have four councilors but certain projects allow them to expand the size of their council to six. Their primary role is to perform <h>missions</h> for their faction.
UI.Codex.codex_professions.Title=Professions
UI.Codex.codex_professions0=A councilor's profession determines the range of his or her initial stats, available missions, and possible traits. 
UI.Codex.codex_recruiting.Title=Recruiting
UI.Codex.codex_recruiting0=Councilors are recruited by spending influence. Recruiting councilors with a diverse set of professions for your council will ensure you have all types of missions available.
UI.Codex.codex_recruiting1=Your pool of councilors to recruit will update on the first of every month as some of the candidate councilors leave.
UI.Codex.codex_attributes.Title=Attributes
UI.Codex.codex_attributes0=A councilor has eight attributes. They determine success chances on missions or offer bonuses to incomes.

UI.Codex.codex_traits.Title=Traits
UI.Codex.codex_traits0=Traits are innate characteristics of a councilor. They may grant permanent or conditions stat bonuses or maluses, incomes, or access to certain orgs. Some traits may be removed or upgraded by spending XP.
UI.Codex.codex_augmentations.Title=Augmentations
UI.Codex.codex_augmentations0=Augmentations are cybernetic implants a councilor can add. They function much like traits.
UI.Codex.codex_XP.Title=Experience
UI.Codex.codex_XP0=<LOC,UI.Councilor.XPTooltip>
UI.Codex.codex_orgs.Title=Orgs
UI.Codex.codex_orgs0=Orgs, or organizations, are government agencies, private companies, and criminal syndicates that a councilor may control. Orgs may provide incomes, stat bonuses, new missions, and bonuses to the faction's investment priorities in nations. Orgs are rated from tier 1 to tier 3 (represented by the number of stars attached to the org icon), and councilors may manage one org tier per point in the administration stat.
UI.Codex.codex_orgs1=Most orgs become available on a faction's exclusive market, and will rotate to be available to another faction after a period of time. Orgs are purchased using money, influence and rarely ops or boost. They may also be acquired via the hostile takeover missions or during trades with other factions. Factions may also gain special orgs for completing objectives or during events. 
UI.Codex.codex_orgs2=Orgs with a monetary value may be sold value back to the market. Factions have a pool of unassiged orgs that can be used to transfer orgs between councilors.
UI.Codex.codex_orgs3=Orgs in the faction pool do not confer any benefits to the faction, but those with negative incomes continue to cost resources to maintain. A faction may only keep 10 non-faction-specific orgs in its faction pool; the rest must be sold or transferred to direct control of a councilor.
UI.Codex.codex_orgs4=Newly acquired orgs for a councilor do not provide bonuses until during the next mission phase, with the exception of administration for the purposes of calculating a councilor's org capacity. If a councilor is detained, all orgs are made inactive.
UI.Codex.codex_missions.Title=Missions
UI.Codex.codex_missions0=Periodically, the game will enter the mission phase, during which all factions will secretly assign their councilors to missions. These missions will be resolved in a sequence over the next few days or weeks. While some missions are automatically successful, most are contested and require a success roll. Missions typically target nations, regions, control points, space facilities, and other councilors.
UI.Codex.codex_missions1=Between mission phases, missions resolve in a partially predetermined order, denoted by the number of small clock symbols visible in the mission description. Uncontested and defensive missions trigger earlier than contested ones. When two councilors are attempting the same mission, the one with the higher mission success chance goes first.
UI.Codex.codex_missions2=For contested missions, the success chance is determined by adding all the relevant bonuses and maluses for a particular mission, and the faction conducting the mission may spend resources to improve its chance of success. If the bonuses and maluses add up to zero, the success chance is 50 percent; otherwise, each point in one direction has a decreasingly powerful impact on the outcome. Changing conditions on Earth can modify success chances between the mission assignment phase and the mission resolution.
UI.Codex.codex_missions3=When a contested mission resolves, a random number between 0 and 100 is generated; if it is less than or equal to the success chance, the mission is a success; otherwise it fails. Results that are less than 10% of the success chance mark a critical success, which typically offers bonuses over a normal success; results in the top 10% of the range of possible failure values are a critical failure and have worse consequences.
UI.Codex.codex_missionList.Title=Missions List
UI.Codex.codex_missionList0=These are the missions available to human councilors in Terra Invicta. 
UI.Codex.codex_missionList_alien.Title=Alien Missions List
UI.Codex.codex_missionList_alien0=During a campaign, factions will unlock knowledge about alien activities on Earth. This list will grow as information about alien and alien-related missions are uncovered.
UI.Codex.codex_detection.Title=Surveillance
UI.Codex.codex_detection0=Going on missions makes a certain amount of noise, with the amount depending on the mission and its outcome. Councilors with high Espionage attributes and in nations where their faction has control points will be harder to detect, while factions where councilors have high investigation scores are more likely to see enemy councilors. Going on the "Surveil Location" mission makes it far more likely you will detect other faction councilors in a particular region or hab.
UI.Codex.codex_detection1=Some councilors may be detected but not fully identified. Targeting that councilor with an <h>Investigate Councilor</h> mission will give you more information on them.
UI.Codex.codex_detection2=If you believe your own councilors have been detected, the <h>Go To Ground</h> mission can make them much harder to follow.
UI.Codex.codex_nations.Title=Nations
UI.Codex.codex_nations0=Nations on Earth serve as battlegrounds for the aliens' designs on Earth and are sites of both political and military conflict. Human factions, using councilors and armies, will compete to control nations in order to make use of their resources to fulfill their objectives. 
UI.Codex.codex_nations1=Most nations in Terra Invicta correspond to a single real-world Earth country, although in several cases adjacent groups of small nations are aggregated into a single nation so they have more relevance to the scale of the game, and any inter-nation issues between within these generally take place below the scale of the simulation. Factions function as something like covert investors in nations, and with enough focus they can take control over the nation's economy and foreign policy.
UI.Codex.codex_regions.Title=Regions
UI.Codex.codex_regions0=Nations are composed of one or more Regions. Regions are named for the primary city in it. The function of regions is primarily geographical, not political; they exist to mark the locations of critical assets and armies. When new nations form or existing ones change, they are composed of regions from other nations. 
UI.Codex.codex_regions1=Regions are home to space facilities: launch facilities that provide boost; mission control facilities, and later in the game, surface-to-orbit defenses.
UI.Codex.codex_regions2=Armies fight in and occupy regions during war.
UI.Codex.codex_regions3=When councilors move around on Earth, they are located in a region and can be detected there, but most of a councilor's work is done at the national level.
UI.Codex.codex_regions4=Regions also may be <h>rugged</h>, meaning armies will take longer to cross it, and defending armies have a substantial advantage during battles. Coastal regions serve as launching and arrival points for armies with a navy upgrade. Regions on or near Earth's equator will gain more boost for a given amount of investment, as launching rockets are able to make use of Earth's greater rotational velocity there.
UI.Codex.codex_claims.Title=Claims
UI.Codex.codex_claims0=Some nations have claims on regions that aren't theirs; these are the regions they may acquire through warfare or secession movements.
UI.Codex.codex_claims1=Some social science projects can unlock new claims during the campaign.
UI.Codex.codex_controlPoints.Title=Control Points
UI.Codex.codex_controlPoints0=<LOC,UI.Nation.ControlPointDescription>
UI.Codex.codex_controlPoints1=Control points come in a variety of types. Their type depends on the national government and other conditions, and provides a related bonus for the faction controlling it. The most important is the <h>Executive</h> control point, which grants its owner direction over the nation's foreign policy.
UI.Codex.codex_controlPoints2=Certain powerful policies, such as joining and leaving federations and merging nations, require <h>consolidated</h> control of the executive, which means the executive faction either gained control of the nation through war or revolution, or must have held continuous control of the executive control point for a certain duration.
UI.Codex.codex_controlPoints3=<LOC,UI.Nation.ControlPointCost>
UI.Codex.codex_incomes.Title=Incomes
UI.Codex.codex_incomes0=Nations provide money, research, boost, and mission control proportionally to factions with control points. Investing in various <h>priorities</h> will increase the pool of these resources provided to all factions.
UI.Codex.codex_nationStats.Title=Nation Stats
UI.Codex.codex_nationStats0=The prosperity and stability of Earth's nations, already tenuous in many places, has been thrown into doubt in light of the alien arrival. These circumstances are tracked and made visible to players, who can take various actions to modify them. The key nation-level values and their roles are:

UI.Codex.codex_publicOpinion.Title=Public Opinion
UI.Codex.codex_publicOpinion0=The people of Earth all hold a particular viewpoint about the alien arrival. But people are malleable, and events and propaganda can sway them to a different point of view.
UI.Codex.codex_publicOpinion1=These viewpoints track with the ideologies of each faction, along with an "undecided" viewpoint in the middle of all of them. Ideologies have a position relative to each other; when events have a chance to change someone's opinion, they will typically move to something nearby -- a Resistance supporter could see their views radicalize to those of Humanity First, or soften to being simply undecided, for example.
UI.Codex.codex_publicOpinion2=Public support for your faction is a primary source of the influence resource. You will also receive bonuses on missions in nations where a large portion of the public is on your side.
UI.Codex.codes_publicOpinion3=A potential mover of public opinion are atrocities committed by a faction. Atrocities are actions that cause mass death or suffering, and responsible factions suffer the loss of supporters as a result. Atrocities are cumulative; as a faction commits more, the public opinion penalty increases dramatically.
UI.Codex.codex_priorities.Title=National Priorites
UI.Codex.codex_priorities0=Investment Points represent surplus economic capital created by a nation. Every nation generates a certain number of Investment Points based on the size of its economy, with subtractions for unrest and the number of armies it has. A nation's <h>priorities</h> control the distribution of these Investment Points. The owner of each control point may direct a share of Investment Points into any number of priorities.
UI.Codex.codex_priorities1=Investments are distributed by setting weights (0, 1, 2 or 3) for each priority, and the amount of investment going to a particular priority depends on the total number of weights set for a particular control point.
UI.Codex.codex_priorities2=Investment Points gradually fill buckets for each priority; once filled, the nation receives the effects of that priority, and in most cases it may be filled again.
UI.Codex.codex_priorities3=Factions may also invest directly in nations by spending money and influence on priorites they chose. This can lead to the rapid completion of armies, launch facilities and other assets. However, a nation can only receive a certain amount of direct investment per year.

UI.Codex.codex_relations.Title=International Relations
UI.Codex.codex_relations0=Nations not at war can be in one of three states with one another: they may be allies, or rivals, or have normal relations.
UI.Codex.codex_relations1=War-capable allies - those with armies or nuclear weapons - will join wars to defend each other when attacked. Allies may also send armies to each other's regions during war or peace. Allies of the lead nation on either side of the war may join a war after it begins.
UI.Codex.codex_relations2=Rivals are nations that may go to war with each other via the Set Policy councilor mission. Human nations will typically suffer a cohesion loss if they declare war upon a new rival.
UI.Codex.codex_relations3=In nations where they have executive control, factions may spend influence <color=#FFFFFFFF><sprite name="influence"></color> to change their bilateral relations with other nations. Any action that improves relations - from rivals to normalized relations, or normalized relations to allies - requires the consent of the other nation. Actions that improve relations also trigger a cooldown between the nations for improving relations again.
UI.Codex.codex_relations4=There are a few restrictions on who can ally and become rivals. Two nonadjacent nations each with only one or two control points may not form alliances or rivalries unless one also has a navy. Nations allied with a breakaway nation cannot ally with breakaway's parent nation; allies of a breakaway's parent cannot ally with the breakaway.
UI.Codex.codex_relations5=Nations also gain cohesion from having "peer" rivals who have at least one control point fewer than they do.
UI.Codex.codex_federations.Title=Federations
UI.Codex.codex_federations0=<LOC,UI.Nation.FederationTooltipDetail>
UI.Codex.codex_policies.Title=Policies
UI.Codex.codex_policies0=Policies are actions the executive faction of a nation can take to dramatically alter the course of the nation. A councilor can use the <h>Set Policy</h> mission to enact policies. Possible policies include:
UI.Codex.codex_terrestrialWarfare.Title=Terrestrial Warfare
UI.Codex.codex_terrestrialWarfare0=Wars begin when a councilor for the executive faction of one of two rivals selects the War policy against the rival. All war-capable allies of the defending rival (with an army or nuclear weapons) join the war. All war-capable allies of the attacker are given the option to join on the attacker's side.
UI.Codex.codex_terrestrialWarfare1=To win a war, an army must occupy the enemy's capital region. At that moment, the war ends, triggering a regime change event. Claimed regions change hands to the occupier and its allies. If any of the invaded nation remains, its control point owners are replaced with those of the victor. Some of the nation's stats change when a new regime is installed, sometimes in unpredictable ways, but the new ruling faction will be able to fund Direct Investments into the nation without paying an influence cost for a period of one year. Unoccupied regions and surviving enemy armies will contribute to greater unrest following a regime change.
UI.Codex.codex_terrestrialWarfare2=Armies may also annex enemy regions during wartime if their home nation has a claim on that region, but any fighting in the region will interrupt and cancel the attempt. Wars may also end with a simple peace where both sides return to the prewar status quo.
UI.Codex.codex_armies.Title=Armies
UI.Codex.codex_armies0=Armies represent multiple modern divisions that are capable of gaining and holding territory in other nations. Control of an army is gained after councilors gain at least partial control of a nation. Most nations don't have armies at the campaign start, but nations with sufficient population can build new ones with enough investment. While powerful, armies are a drag on a nation's economic development and remain subject to the international relations of their home countries, which too can be managed with sufficient control of a nation.
UI.Codex.codex_armies1=Armies have a headquarters region in their home nation. If located there, they incur a smaller cost to the nation's economic development.
UI.Codex.codex_armies2=Armies rely on two key values: its parent nation's miltech level and its strength. The strength value measures how much damage the army has taken. Armies repair themselves when not fighting in a friendly region.
UI.Codex.codex_armies3=Some armies have a <h>Navy</h> upgrade that allows them to transit oceans. During wartime, a nation's navies can only cross the water if the nation has naval superiority over its foes. Only larger or wealthier nations have the capability to build and project power with navies.
UI.Codex.codex_armies4=Destruction of an army grants Investment Points in its home nation's Build Army priority, representing reconstitution of the army with survivors of the prior unit. Destruction of an army with a navy also grants Investment Points in its home nation's Build Navy priority.
UI.Codex.codex_armyOperations.Title=Army Operations
UI.Codex.codex_armyOperations0=The faction that controls an army can conduct operations with it. They are:
UI.Codex.codex_armyBattles.Title=Army Battles
UI.Codex.codex_armyBattles0=If at least two enemy armies are in the same region, they will fight. Mechanically, each army takes a shot once a day. Its chance of successfully damaging an enemy army is based on its miltech level, strength, whether any councilors are lending their command attribute to the army's nation via the Advise mission, and whether it is defending and the region has the "rugged" flag set.
UI.Codex.codex_armyBattles1=If an army is in an enemy region and no enemy armies are present, it begins occupying the region, battling the local defense forces (who use the nation's tech level) and taking damage from them. Badly damaged armies will attempt to flee to a safe place without you doing anything, but they can also be destroyed entirely when their strength reaches zero.
UI.Codex.codex_armyBattles2=If a region is fully occupied it ceases fighting, but it can't change hands until the war is concluded. Regional economies and space facilities can take significant damage during fighting, although the rate of damage goes down as miltech goes up (representing more precise weaponry). Sufficient damage will count as an atrocity by the army's owning faction.
UI.Codex.codex_navalSuperiority.Title=Naval Superiority
UI.Codex.codex_navalSuperiority0=<LOC,UI.Nation.NavalDetail>
UI.Codex.codex_nuclearWarfare.Title=Nuclear Warfare
UI.Codex.codex_nuclearWarfare0=Some nations have a number of nuclear attacks available to them. These represent launching multiple strategic nuclear weapons at a target region. Launching nuclear strikes will devastate the economy of a region and the enemy armies within it, although the damage will be somewhat mitigated if a nation is launching strikes on its own or an ally's territory. Launching factions will be charged with committing one or more atrocities. Detonating a sufficient number of nuclear weapons may also have disasterious global effects.
UI.Codex.codex_nuclearWarfare1=Completing the nuclear weapons priority can add more nuclear attacks for a nation.
UI.Codex.codex_nuclearWarfare2=Nations construct nuclear weapons as a deterrent to enemy invasion. Attempting to conquer a nuclear-armed nation will almost certainly lead to nuclear strikes in retaliation.
UI.Codex.codex_solarSystem.Title=Solar System
UI.Codex.codex_solarSystem0=Terra Invicta models the larger bodies in Earth's Solar System out to a distance of roughly 50 times the distance of the Earth from the Sun. This includes much of the Kuiper Belt, the group of icy bodies orbiting beyond Neptune.
UI.Codex.codex_solarSystem1=The Solar System also includes Lagrange Points as locations fleets may travel to. These are stable anchorages created by the confluence of gravity between two bodies and marked on the map with geometric shapes.
UI.Codex.codex_orbits.Title=Orbits
UI.Codex.codex_orbits0=All space bodies and Lagrange Points have one or more circular orbits around them where factions can send fleets and build a limited number of space stations. Fleets don't require any propellant to remain in their position in an orbit.
UI.Codex.codex_orbits1=Orbits close to a space body's surface are called <h>interface</h> orbits. These are orbits fleets can travel to in order to land or bombard targets on the surface. Around Earth, some hab modules grant bonuses if they are in an interface orbit as they provide greater benefits to the surface.
UI.Codex.codex_orbits2=Higher-altitude orbits typically cost less Delta-V to launch from to reach other moons and planetary systems.
UI.Codex.codex_orbits3=Some orbits are marked with a hazard symbol <color=#FFFFFFFF><sprite name=irradiated_site></color>. These orbits receive high levels of radiation, and space stations built there require shielding and are much heavier and more costly than stations built elsewhere.
UI.Codex.codex_orbits4=A few orbits also produce small amounts of <color=#FFFFFFFF><sprite name="antimatter"></color>antimatter that may be harvested with hab modules you can develop.
UI.Codex.codex_habSites.Title=Hab Sites
UI.Codex.codex_habSites0=With the exception of the hellish world of Venus, and the gas giants Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, all space bodies have at least one hab site where factions may build a base with a mine and other modules. Larger bodies will have four, eight, nine or 16 hab sites, depending on their size.
UI.Codex.codex_habSites1=When a mine is built, a hab site will provide certain space resources to the faction that controls the mine. The type of resources generally depends on the composition of the space body.
UI.Codex.codex_habSites2=When first viewing the Solar System, factions will only have estimates of the space resources a mine at a particular hab site can provide. To discover their exact potential, they will need to conduct a prospecting survey of the parent space body.
UI.Codex.codex_habSites3=Some hab sites are marked with a hazard symbol <color=#FFFFFFFF><sprite name=irradiated_site></color>. These sites receive high levels of radiation, and bases built there require shielding and are much heavier and more costly than bases built elsewhere.
UI.Codex.codex_probes.Title=Prospecting Surveys
UI.Codex.codex_probes0=To build a base, a faction must first survey the space body to determine the precise location for the habitat. Prospecting a space body will also reveal its precising mining output.
UI.Codex.codex_probes1=Prospecting can be conducted by a probe launched from Earth or from a shipyard at a hab, or by ships equipped with a space science lab module. Prospecting data may also be stolen from other factions.
UI.Codex.codex_research.Title=Research
UI.Codex.codex_research0=In Terra Invicta, the process of research is divided into science and engineering. Factions must decide how to direct their research <color=#FFFFFFFF><sprite name="research"></color> income between public endeavors to advance humanity's understanding of the universe, and narrowly focused private efforts aimed at fulfilling specific objectives or improving their faction's capabilities.
UI.Codex.codex_research1=The human factions collectively research three new scientific principles at once. These are broad understandings of how things like physics, or chemistry, or people, work. Only rarely do they directly lead to some specific change in how events unfold in the game. Instead, their main function is to unlock engineering projects for individual factions.
UI.Codex.codex_research2=The faction that contributes the most research to a particular principle will select what is investigated next. Contributing research also increases the chance a faction will unlock projects related to the tech.
UI.Codex.codex_research3=With sufficient infrastructure, factions may research up to three private engineering projects simultaneously. Projects will typically either trigger an effect or unlock a new component for your ships and habs. A scientific principle might be "Directed Energy Weapons Doctrine," and it's one prerequisite for the "60 cm infrared laser battery" project, which in turn unlocks a new weapon system for your ships.
UI.Codex.codex_projects.Title=Projects
UI.Codex.codex_projects0=Not every faction will get access to every project. Each project has a trigger percentage for each faction. While certain critical projects will always be available to all factions; for many, only a few factions may have access to it, and it's possible some non-vital techs may not appear in a particular campaign at all, simulating that it's unclear whether some real-world ideas will actually work.
UI.Codex.codex_projects1=Projects won't always become available immediately after the world hits the prerequisites for them. While public techs are locked in until completion, factions may change a project you are pursuing at any time and bank the completed research. Some projects are also repeatable, but cost more for each time a faction completes it.
UI.Codex.codex_projects2=Some councilors may steal completed projects from other factions.
UI.Codex.codex_projects3=A number of projects are tied to completing objectives that move factions closer to understanding the purpose of the alien invasion or toward its victory conditions.
UI.Codex.codex_techCategories.Title=Tech Categories
UI.Codex.codex_techCategories0=Many game elements grant bonuses to specific areas of research. This is typically on a diminishing-returns basis. These tech categories are:
UI.Codex.codex_habitats.Title=Habitats
UI.Codex.codex_habitats0=Habitats, or habs, are space-based facilities operated by factions. Factions may build two types of habs: stations, which go in an orbit, and bases, which go at a hab site. 
UI.Codex.codex_habitats1=Both types of habs come in three sizes. Stations grow from platforms, to orbitals, and then to rings. Bases start as outposts, grow to settlements, and finally become colonies.
UI.Codex.codex_habitats2=Habs are composed of modules. All modules have a core module; the size of the core determines the size of the hab. The size of the hab determines both how many modules you can have (4, 12 or 20, plus the core), and the maximum size of each module.
UI.Codex.codex_habitats3=Most hab modules consume power. You must build sufficient power-generating modules to accommodate your other modules. Modules may be turned off to reduce power consumption, although certain modules must remain on if there is power to support them in the hab. Modules also have a maintenance cost in space resources, which can be paid with boost and money if sufficient space resources aren't available. Some modules also have a mission control cost, as well.
UI.Codex.codex_foundingHabs.Title=Founding Habs
UI.Codex.codex_foundingHabs0=Habs may be founded in three ways. One is to launch the core module from Earth, using boost. This can take a lot of time if the location is far from the homeworld. A second is to develop and build kits that ships can deploy when they arrive in an orbit or land on a space body. A third is to found habs from other habs in the same planetary system that have a construction module.
UI.Codex.codex_automatedHabs.Title=Automated Habs
UI.Codex.codex_automatedHabs0=Once you have developed sufficient technology, you may deploy automated habs. These are small robotic installations that may only include other automated modules that you develop. They will typically function as a small mine or a supply station for your ships. They will take more mission control but typically not as many space resources to support.
UI.Codex.codex_automatedHabs1=Note that automated habs cannot use standard modules (with a crew), and cannot be upgraded into a standard habs.
UI.Codex.codex_buildingHabs.Title=Building Habs
UI.Codex.codex_buildingHabs0=Hab modules are added to habs either by shipping them from Earth using boost or building them out of space materials. Some modules have upgrade paths to larger versions; upgrading a module in this way is done at a discount.
UI.Codex.codex_assaultingHabs.Title=Assaulting Habs
UI.Codex.codex_assaultingHabs0=Fleets with Marines and councilors with the Assault Enemy Space Asset mission and access to fleet or hab Marines may assault enemy habs to attempt to capture them. In either case, the assault will use all available Marines at a location to launch the assault, including Marines from other fleets docked at the same location. Habs are defended by Marine modules. When attacking a base from orbit, habs with active surface-to-orbit defensive modules will contribute to the defense as well. Both sides may suffer damage or destruction of Marine modules that take part in the assault.
UI.Codex.codex_assaultingHabs1=Councilors using the Assault mission are able to contribute their Command stat and the Ops resource to the battle, increasing their chances of success relative to fleet-initiated assaults.
UI.Codex.codex_shipDesign.Title=Ship Design
UI.Codex.codex_shipDesign0=All the covert machinations on Earth and industrialization efforts in space are the path for factions to build fleets of ships to protect and advance their interests. Once the factions unlock the early-game orbital shipbuilding tech, and the follow-on space dock project for their habs, they can build interplanetary spacecraft.
UI.Codex.codex_shipDesign1=With the right modules, ships can prospect and found habitats, but the primary role for most ships is combat. 
UI.Codex.codex_shipDesign2=At any time, you can design ships out of the modules you've developed. Once you have a shipyard, you can build the ships themselves out of your space resources and, if necessary, boost and money.
UI.Codex.codes_shipDesign3=Critical values to manage when building your ships are mass, acceleration and Delta-V. More mass means less acceleration and a less maneuverable ship. Delta-V measures how much you can change your velocity; it governs how quickly you can get somewhere. 
UI.Codex.codex_hull.Title=Hull
UI.Codex.codex_hull0=Designing a ship begins with selecting a hull. The type of hull determines the number of nose and hull weapon hard points, the number of utility modules, and the length of the hull. 
UI.Codex.codex_hull1=Shorter ships will have a lower amount of inertia, meaning they will rotate faster than their longer counterparts.
UI.Codex.codex_drive.Title=Drive
UI.Codex.codex_drive0=<LOC,UI.Fleets.Drive.Description>
UI.Codex.codex_powerPlant.Title=Power Plant
UI.Codex.codex_powerPlant0=<LOC,UI.Fleets.PowerPlant.Description>
UI.Codex.codex_radiators.Title=Radiators
UI.Codex.codex_radiators0=<LOC,UI.Fleets.Radiator.Description>
UI.Codex.codex_batteries.Title=Batteries
UI.Codex.codex_batteries0=<LOC,UI.Fleets.Battery.Description>
UI.Codex.codex_weapons.Title=Weapons
UI.Codex.codex_weapons0=Weapons systems are either mounted on the ship's nose or on the hull. Nose weapons are typically more powerful than hull weapons of a similar size, but they have a limited field of fire. Hull weapons can fire in any direction around the ship.
UI.Codex.codex_weapons1=Weapons also come in various sizes; larger weapon systems will take up multiple weapon slots in the ship's hull.
UI.Codex.codex_weapons2=Weapons can be classified in three general types: beam weapons, which fire at the speed of light and confer instantaneous damage to their target; projectile weapons, which propel unguided munitions at a target and use kinetic and sometimes chemical energy to defeat the target; and missiles, which are self-guided weapon systems that chase a target until it runs out of propellant.
UI.Codex.codex_weapons3=Certain weapons may only be used offensively against enemy ships and hab modules; others may only be used defensively to shoot down incoming projectiles and missiles, and still others can be used against both types of targets.
UI.Codex.codex_armor.Title=Armor
UI.Codex.codex_armor0=Armor plating on the ship will absorb incoming weapons fire, preventing damage to internal components. Each point of armor will absorb 20 Megajoules of energy at a single location on the hull before vaporizing. Different armor types require a different thickness and mass to absorb a particular amount of damage.
UI.Codex.codex_propellantTanks.Title=Propellant Tanks
UI.Codex.codex_propellantTanks0=Each ship must have one or more 100-ton propellant tanks. The number of propellant tanks determines the ship's Delta-V value.
UI.Codex.codex_fleets.Title=Fleets
UI.Codex.codex_fleets0=Fleets consist of one or more ships that are directed by one of the human factions or the aliens. Fleets conduct operations and fight in space battles.
UI.Codex.codex_shipConstruction.Title=Ship Construction
UI.Codex.codex_shipConstruction0=Individual ships are constructed at habs at a space dock, shipyard, or spaceworks module. Ships may be built out of a mix of resources mined in space and material boosted from Earth. When construction is complete, ships are deployed docked at the hab that built them.
UI.Codex.codex_shipRefits.Title=Refits
UI.Codex.codex_shipRefits0=Factions may refit ships at habs with ship construction modules. Refitting is generally limited to replacing parts of a similar type.<br/><br/>Hull cannot change.<br/>Power Plant can change, if the new Power Plant is of the same Class.<br/>Drives can add or remove thrusters to current drive, or substitute a drive with the same Classification, required Power Plant, and Propellant type.<br/>Weapons can change if the new weapon is of the same Class and Mount (so 1-hull laser can only be replaced by 1-hull lasers).<br/>Armor can change freely.<br/>Batteries can change to other batteries freely, but not change with other Utility modules.<br/>Heat sinks can change freely, but not change with other Utility modules.<br/>Radiators can change freely.<br/>Utility modules that aren't batteries or heat sinks can change to other modules with the same Class.
UI.Codex.codex_propellant.Title=Delta-V
UI.Codex.codex_propellant0=The term <h>Delta-V</h> is shorthand for change in velocity. It's a measure of a ship's ability to reach a given destination in a reasonable amount of time. Expending the limited resource of propellant to create thrust reduces a ship's available Delta-V as it empties its propellant tanks.
UI.Codex.codex_propellant1=A ship's Delta-V is a product of its overall mass, how much propellant it has, and the efficiency of its drive in using propellant, which is termed specific impulse or <h>exhaust velocity</h>. Terra Invicta uses the latter term.
UI.Codex.codex_propellant2=Depending on the ship's thrust and the gravity at its location in the Solar System, a ship may be able to plot faster routes to other destinations by expending extra Delta-V.
UI.Codex.codex_propellant3=A fleet's Delta-V is simply the lowest Delta-V of all the ships in the fleet.
UI.Codex.codex_propellant4=Ships must resupply their propellant loads at habs with supply depots or shipyards.
UI.Codex.codex_transfers.Title=Transfers
UI.Codex.codex_transfers0=A transfer is the term for a fleet moving from one place to another while staying in space. Fleets may transfer to orbits, stations, or other fleets.
UI.Codex.codex_transfers1=When initiating a transfer operation, a fleet will receive one or more trajectory options if it can reach its destination at all. If multiple trajectories are possible, the player may choose between trading off arrival time and Delta-V expenditure between them.
UI.Codex.codex_transfers2=Trajectories might be <h>microthrust spirals</h>, which are typical for fleets with low acceleration; <h>impulse conics</h>, for fleets with high acceleration but low Delta-V; or <h>torch chords</h>, for advanced fleets with high acceleration and Delta-V.
UI.Codex.codex_fleetOperations.Title=Fleet Operations
UI.Codex.codex_fleetOperations0=Fleets may undertake various operations, typically only when they are in orbit and not in a transfer. They are:
UI.Codex.codex_orbitalBombardment.Title=Orbital Bombardment
UI.Codex.codex_orbitalBombardment0=A fleet equipped with magnetic, laser or nuclear weapons may conduct orbital bombardment against targets on the surface of a space body. They must be in an interface orbit to launch attacks. 
UI.Codex.codex_orbitalBombardment1=Above Earth, valid targets include armies, space facilities, regions, and any alien assets we have detected. On other space bodies, bases and landed space fleets may be targeted.
UI.Codex.codex_orbitalBombardment2=Certain weapons, such as lasers that fire in ultraviolet wavelenghts, cannot bombard through thicker atmospheres, particularly that of Earth and Titan.
UI.Codex.codex_orbitalBombardment3=If a targeted hab or region has defenses, they will fire back at the attacking fleet and attempt to shoot down projectiles and missiles.
UI.Codex.codex_orbitalBombardment4=The bombarding fleet may choose the altitude it engages the target at, trading off risk for damage. At higher altitudes, lasers on both sides will be less effective, and the defenses will have a greater opportunity to shoot down projectiles and missiles.
UI.Codex.codex_spaceCombat.Title=Space Combat
UI.Codex.codex_spaceCombat0=When two fleets from enemy factions meet in an orbit, deep space, or at a station, a space battle begins. Players may elect to autoresolve combats.
UI.Codex.codex_spaceCombat1=Before a battle begins, each fleet will select from one of three stances: Engage, Accept, or Evade. At least one fleet must select "Engage" for a battle to occur; if the other fleet selects "Evade," both fleets may bid Delta-V to conduct the pursuit. If the fleet that selected "Engage" enters the higher bid, the combat will take place. Fleets that are docked at habs or are unavailable for operations because of previous battles may only select the "Accept" option.
UI.Codex.codex_spaceCombat2=In a pursuit, the two fleets' relative accelerations determine how the chase will play out. If one fleet can significantly out-accelerate its opponent, it can force the engagement, or dodge it for little Delta-V. Two fleets with similar accelerations will engage in a slow stern chase, potentially spending a great deal of DV to resolve, if both sides commit to spending it. A pursuit ends when the chasing fleet closes a predetermined distance to its quarry, or the evading fleet extends the distance between to the two fleets by the same amount.
UI.Codex.codex_spaceCombat3=Stations with defensive modules will take part in battles; they will be considered disabled if those modules are destroyed.
UI.Codex.codex_spaceCombat4=Very large space battles will have active and reinforcing ships. Reinforcing ships will join during combat at a later time to replace active ships when they are destroyed. You can adjust the maximum number of ships that can be active at any time during combat in the gameplay settings in the options menu. A maximum value of 30 for example, will limit each side to having a maximum of 15 active ships at any time. This is for performance reasons in very large battles.
UI.Codex.codex_spaceCombat5=When a fleet or station is attacked, allied fleets of the defender in the same orbit and less than 1,000 kilometers away will be drawn into the battle and join the defending fleet.
UI.Codex.codex_maneuvers.Title=Maneuvers
UI.Codex.codex_maneuvers0=Once in combat, players plan maneuvers their ships by setting waypoints in 3D space. Ships will turn and thrust to reach their waypoints. Players may also rotate a ship's facing independent of its direction of travel to present certain weapons or armor facings to an enemy.
UI.Codex.codex_specialManeuvers.Title=Special Maneuvers
UI.Codex.codex_specialManeuvers0=Special maneuvers include persistent spins, rolls, and a padlocking-target command that keeps the ship's nose pointed at its primary target.
UI.Codex.codex_fireControl.Title=Fire Control
UI.Codex.codex_fireControl0=Weapons have one or more fire modes available to them. They can be set at the fleet, ship, or individual weapon level during combat.
UI.Codex.codex_fireControl1=Ships may also designate an enemy ship or hab module as its primary target. The ship's weapons will favor that enemy over others. Missile weapons require a primary target to fire.
UI.Codex.codex_fireControl2=Depending on their capabilities, weapons may also be set to only attack enemy ships, only fire defensively at incoming projectiles and missiles, or in "guardian" mode, firing first at threatening projectiles and then targeting enemy craft.
UI.Codex.codex_heatManagement.Title=Heat Management
UI.Codex.codex_heatManagement0=Running the ship's power plant to recharge the batteries or operate the drive creates heat that is normally expelled by the ship's radiators, which cannot be armored. In combat, radiators may be retracted to protect them, but the ship must put all its heat into heat sinks, which have a limited capacity. The heat level will lower automatically when the radiators are extended. If the heat level stored in heat sinks reaches maximum, the ship will start to take internal damage. In combat, the radiators will automatically be extended to start radiating heat if possible. <h>Keep in mind, without proper heat management a ship will experience catastrophic failure.</h> 
UI.Codex.codex_batteryManagement.Title=Battery Management
UI.Codex.codex_batteryManagement0=A ship's battery serves as its power source for when the power plant is being used for propulsion or damaged.
UI.Codex.codex_damage.Title=Damage Control
UI.Codex.codex_damage0=Any damage that penetrates a ship's armor is applied to its internal systems. Weapons and other modules may be temporarily disabled or permanently destroyed, requiring repair at a hab with a shipyard.
UI.Codex.codex_damage1=Damage control teams will also attempt to restore function to critical systems in combat.
